=begin
 Because everything in Ruby is an object (more on this later), everything in Ruby has certain built-in abilities called methods. You can think of methods as “skills” that certain objects have. For instance, strings (words or phrases) have built-in methods that can tell you the length of the string, reverse the string, and more.
=end

# the "=begin" and "=end" are ways to comment multiple lines at once. If you do "=begin" it's VERY important to end with "=end".
# It's visually better to use individual hash (#) marks though to quickly pick up comment lines.
